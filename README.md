🆘 Uhai Assist — AI Smart Emergency Response System

When Every Second Counts, AI Responds

A web-based emergency assistance platform built to save lives in Kenya and across Africa through AI-guided first aid, QR-coded medical identity, and instant access to rescue services.

🚑 Problem

Every year, thousands of people die because:

Bystanders don’t know what to do during emergencies

Medical responders don’t have instant info on the victim

Emergency contacts cannot be reached quickly

Hospitals receive late or missing critical data

These delays cost lives.

✅ Solution: Uhai Assist

Uhai Assist provides real-time emergency support:

⭐ Key Core Features

✅ AI-Guided First Aid — step-by-step instructions during emergencies

✅ QR Medical ID Wristbands — scan to view vital info instantly

✅ Emergency Contacts Directory — hospitals, Red Cross, AMREF

✅ User Medical Profile — blood type, allergies, chronic conditions

✅ Map-Based Hospital Locator — nearest help in seconds

✅ User & Admin Dashboards

Admin: Manage first aid tutorials + emergency contacts

User: Direct access to emergency support tools

🎯 Vision

Build a reliable, accessible, life-saving emergency network
designed for Kenya and underserved African communities.

Because technology can save lives — if it responds faster than an ambulance.
